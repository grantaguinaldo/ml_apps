### Work breakdown for this Image Classifier

* Add in a button to the DOM that reads "Upload Image."
* Add in tag where we can change the innerHTML to hold the prediction text.
* Build out a function where people can upload an image. Have the image stored in the app itself.
* Render the uploaded image to the DOM.
* Add in a button to the DOM that reads "Predict."
* Build out a function that will grab the image and use tensorflow.js to make the prediction.
* Once the model is done, we'll need to take the results and render it back to the DOM using innerHTML.
